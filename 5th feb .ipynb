A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). An object is an instance of a class, created from a class. For example, a class named \"Car\" can have attributes such as color, make, model, and methods such as start, drive, stop, etc.\n",
